# sipdate

sipdate inserts date stamps into SIP packets sent from germanyâ€™s popular router Fritz!Box
to attached IP phones. This is needed for certain Cisco models in order to be able to use the newest firmware.

See [1] for more details and network configuration.
libnetfilter_queue needs to be installed and  an iptables rule set.

make_sipdate.sh fetches, copies and patches needed files from libnetfilter_queue,
builds and installs binary and systemd service.
